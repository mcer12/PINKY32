# PINKY32
PINKY32 is a compact low-power STM32F030F4P6 dev board.
- Tiny. Smaller form factor than Arduino Nano (see images)
- CH340 onboard for easy firmware flashing and serial communication. Perfect for fast development.
- Simple slider switch to select boot mode
- Low quiescent current voltage regulator => it's low-power application ready drawing only few uA in shutdown sleep mode.

STM32F030 is capable of 16bit PWM (have tested 12bit in Arduino IDE), this is perfect for slow dimming for example. Much better than 8bit Atmega328 in arduino.
